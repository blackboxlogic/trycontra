The source code for trycontra.com

index.html is the main page, containing both the display and the scripts

dances.json is the manual-editing dance database.  Add stuff to that
then run lookup_locs.py, which adds location information to
dances.json to create dances_locs.json

zipcode.json is a giant map from zipcode to lat/lng.

index.html loads zipcode.json and dances_locs.json via ajax.

about.html is an about page.


How to update zipcodes:
* you can get them from anywhere, but I found this one easy:
    http://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/zip-code-database/
* once you have their .csv you can run:
    python build_zipcode_json.py <their-csv-file>
